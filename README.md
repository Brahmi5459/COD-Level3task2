Description: 
To build a deep learning model for image recognition tasks using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and achieve above 80% accuracy, we can follow these steps:

Data Preparation and Preprocessing:

Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Normalize the pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Augment the dataset to increase diversity.
CNN Architecture Design:

Design a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
Alternatively, employ transfer learning with pretrained models like VGG16 or ResNet50 for improved performance.
Model Training:

Compile and train the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Use data augmentation to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test set.
Visualize the model's predictions to assess its effectiveness.
Let's go step-by-step with implementation using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

Step 1: Data Preparation and Preprocessing
First, let's load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Step 2: CNN Architecture Design
Next, let's design a CNN architecture. We'll use transfer learning with a pretrained model, such as ResNet50.

Step 3: Model Training
Now, let's train the model using the augmented data.

Step 4: Model Evaluation
Finally, evaluate the model's performance on the test set and visualize some predictions.
Conclusion
This implementation leverages transfer learning with the ResNet50 model and augments the CIFAR-10 dataset to achieve high accuracy. You can tune the hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) and experiment with different data augmentation techniques to further improve performance and reach the desired accuracy of above 80%
